/** \name Version Numbers

    FLTK defines some constants to help the programmer to
    find out, for which FLTK version a program is compiled.

    The following constants are defined:
 */
/**@{*/

/**
   The major release version of this FLTK library.
   \see FL_VERSION
 */
#define FL_MAJOR_VERSION        1

/**
   The minor release version for this library.

   FLTK remains mostly source-code compatible between minor version changes.
 */
#define FL_MINOR_VERSION        4

/**
   The patch version for this library.

   FLTK remains binary compatible between patches.
 */

/**
    The FLTK version number as a \em double.

    FL_VERSION is a \em double that describes the major, minor, and patch
    version numbers.

    Version 1.2.3 is actually stored as 1.0203 to allow for more than 9
    minor and patch releases.

    \deprecated This \p double version number is retained for compatibility
    with existing program code. New code should use \em int FL_API_VERSION
    instead. FL_VERSION is deprecated because comparisons of floating point
    values may fail due to rounding errors. However, there are currently no
    plans to remove this deprecated constant.

    FL_VERSION is equivalent to <em>(double)FL_API_VERSION / 10000</em>.

    \see Fl::version() (deprecated as well)
    \see FL_API_VERSION
    \see Fl::api_version()
 */

    minor and patch releases.

    The FL_MAJOR_VERSION, FL_MINOR_VERSION, and FL_PATCH_VERSION constants
    give the integral values for the major, minor, and patch releases
    respectively.

    \em double FL_VERSION.

    \see Fl::api_version()

    The FLTK ABI (Application Binary Interface) version number as an \em int.

    FL_ABI_VERSION is an \em int that describes the major, minor, and patch
    ABI version numbers in the same format as FL_API_VERSION.

    The ABI version number \p FL_ABI_VERSION is usually the same as the
    API version \p FL_API_VERSION with the last two digits set to '00'.

    FLTK retains the ABI (Application Binary Interface) during patch
    releases of the same major and minor versions. Examples:

    \verbatim
      FLTK Version  FL_API_VERSION  FL_ABI_VERSION  FL_VERSION (deprecated)
        1.3.0          10300           10300           1.0300
        1.3.4          10304           10300           1.0304
    \endverbatim

    Version 1.2.3 is actually stored as 10203 to allow for more than 9
    minor and patch releases.

    The FL_MAJOR_VERSION, FL_MINOR_VERSION, and FL_PATCH_VERSION constants
    give the integral values for the major, minor, and patch releases
    respectively.

    To enable new ABI-breaking features in patch releases you can configure
    FLTK to use a higher FL_ABI_VERSION.

    Every time a user moves the mouse pointer, clicks a button,

    most recent event is stored in static locations and acquired by
    calling the Fl::event_*() methods. This static information remains
    valid until the next event is read from the window system, so it
    is ok to look at it outside of the handle() method.

      It then becomes the Fl::focus() widget and gets FL_KEYDOWN, FL_KEYUP,

      window gets the focus, or because the user tried to navigate using tab,

    \brief FLTK standard box types

    This enum defines the standard box types included with FLTK.

   \note The documented \p enum \p Fl_Boxtype contains some values (names)
      with leading underscores, e.g. \p \b _FL_SHADOW_BOX. This is due to
      technical reasons - please use the same values (names) without the
      leading underscore in your code! Enum values with leading underscores
      are reserved for internal use and subject to change without notice!

    FL_NO_BOX means nothing is drawn at all, so whatever is already
    on the screen remains. The FL_..._FRAME types only draw their edges,
    leaving the interior unchanged. The blue color in the image below
    is the area that is not drawn by the frame types.

/** \name Alignment Flags
  Flags to control the label alignment.

  This controls how the label is displayed next to or inside the widget.
  The default value is FL_ALIGN_CENTER (0) for most widgets, which centers
  the label inside the widget.

  All alignment flags use the common prefix "FL_ALIGN_". In the following
  descriptions this prefix is sometimes omitted for brevity.

  Flags can be or'd to achieve a combination of alignments, but there
  are some \e "magic values" (e.g. combinations of TOP and BOTTOM and of
  LEFT and RIGHT) that have special meanings (see below). For instance:\n
  FL_ALIGN_TOP_LEFT == (FL_ALIGN_TOP | FL_ALIGN_LEFT) != FL_ALIGN_LEFT_TOP.

  \code
    Outside alignments (FL_ALIGN_INSIDE is not set):

               TOP_LEFT        TOP       TOP_RIGHT
